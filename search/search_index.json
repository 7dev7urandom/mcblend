Usage Toggles mc_mirror - Toggles mc_mirror property for selected object. Objects that has mc_mirror property create cubes with mirrored uv. Set mc_uv_group - Groups selected object together which affects the UV-mapping. Object asigned to the same mc_uv_group are mapped to the same spot on the texture if they have the same dimensions. Toggle mc_is_bone - Toggles mc_is_bone property for selected objects. object whit this property are exported as bones in Minecraft model. Set mc_inflate - Set the mc_inflate vale for selected objects. This is equivalent to setting the inflate value in Minecraft model. Set bedrock UVs panel This panel is used for creating UV-mapping for the model and generating template textures. Usage By default all of the cubes in the model have the [0, 0] uv-mapping. The uv mapping vlaues of each object are stored in mc_uv custom property. To perform the uv-mapping set the values in the form and press \"Set minecraft UVs\" Texture width - the texture width property of the Minecraft model. Texture height - the texture height property of the Minecraft model. If you sent this property to 0 the texture height will be selected automatically to fit all textures as tight as possible. Move existing mcUv mappings - this chceckbox decides if the cubes that already have assigned uv-mapping values can be moved. Move blender UV mappings - this checkbox decides if blender objects should have their UV-mapping moved to match the minecraft model. Remove old UV maps - objects in blender can have multiple UV mpas but only one of them is visible. Ticking this box causes that old uv-maps are removed when the new one is created. Template resolution - Sets the resolution of the template texture. If you set this to 0 than the template texture won't be created. This value describes how many pixels on the image is represented by one texture_widht or texture_height unit in model definition. The value 1 gives the standard Minecraft texture resolution. Higher values can be used to create \"HD\" textures. Set minecraft UVs button runs the operator which plans the UV-mapping and optionally creates the template texture. Export bedrock model panel This panel is used for exporting the models. Usage Set the model to its neutral pose. Use frame 0 (frame before the animation starts) and add a keyframe with neutral model position to it. Select all of the objects that you want to export. Insert the name of the model. Press the \"Export model\" button. Export bedrock animation panel This panel is used for exporting animations. Usage Select all of the objects to export. Insert the name of the animation. If you want loop the animation select the \"loop\" checkbox. If you want to use the anim_time_update property of minecraft animation insert its value to a proper textfield.
