Opening this tab reveals panels which are used to accesss most of the functionallity of the addon. Additionally there is custom operator for parenting the objects for minecraft model, that you can find in 3D viewport, in Object -> Parent menu (number 2 on the image). Limitations Minecraft models for bedrock edition support only cuboids. This means that the exported model also needs to be created out of cuboids only. Every meash which is not a cuboid will use its bounding box in process of exporting the model.Note that a mesh which has one cuboid in it but tilted in relation to the object rotation isn't considered to be a cuboid. A good way to avoid mistakes caused by meshes with a wrong shape ist to enable display of bounding box in object properties in Blender see if object is a proper cuboid Properties -> Object properties -> Viewport display -> Bounds (checkobx) (number 3 in the image).

Addon decides what should become an mcbone, mccube or locator by following the certain set of rules. The rules are cheked in the same order as the list below. Conversion rules for empties: Empty with mc_is_bone property becomes an mcbone. Empty without parents becomes an mcbone. Empty with children ( mc_parent property in another object pointing at the empty) becomes mcbone. Empty in every other case (empty with no mc_is_bone propety, with parent and without children) becomes a locator. Conversion rules for meshes: If the mesh has a child defined by custom property ( mc_parent in another object) it creates mcbone with one mccube in it. If the mesh has custom property mc_is_bone than the object becomes a mcbone with one mccube in it. Mesh with parent and without children becomes a mccube and is added to a list of mccubes of parent mcbone. In every other case (mesh without parent and without children) becomes a mcbone with single mccube in it. Remember that mccubes can't be animated.
