This directory contains python modules with the same names as some of the
blender modules to make documentation generation possible.

The modules from this directory don't have mock objects for everything from
blender modules and I don't plan to make this complete. It's made just to
prevent errors during process of generating documentation.

It will be removed from the project as soon as I find less hacky solution than
that.
